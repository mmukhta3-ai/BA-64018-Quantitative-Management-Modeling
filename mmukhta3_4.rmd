**1. Problem Formulation**
Weigelt Corporation has 3 plants with excess capacity. They must decide how many Large (L), Medium (M), and Small (S) units to produce at each plant to maximize profit.

Decision Variables:
x1L, x1M, x1S = Units produced at Plant 1
x2L, x2M, x2S = Units produced at Plant 2
x3L, x3M, x3S = Units produced at Plant 3

Objective Function:
Maximize Z = 420(x1L+x2L+x3L) + 360(x1M+x2M+x3M) + 300(x1S+x2S+x3S)

Constraints include:
- Capacity per plant
- Storage limits
- Demand limits
- Equal utilization of excess capacity
- Non-negativity

**2. R Code**
```{r}
library(lpSolve)

# Objective Coefficients
objective <- c(420,360,300, 420,360,300, 420,360,300)

# Constraints
constraints <- matrix(c(
  1,1,1, 0,0,0, 0,0,0,   # Plant 1 capacity
  0,0,0, 1,1,1, 0,0,0,   # Plant 2 capacity
  0,0,0, 0,0,0, 1,1,1,   # Plant 3 capacity
  20,15,12, 0,0,0, 0,0,0, # Plant 1 storage
  0,0,0, 20,15,12, 0,0,0, # Plant 2 storage
  0,0,0, 0,0,0, 20,15,12, # Plant 3 storage
  1,0,0, 1,0,0, 1,0,0,   # Demand large
  0,1,0, 0,1,0, 0,1,0,   # Demand medium
  0,0,1, 0,0,1, 0,0,1    # Demand small
), nrow=9, byrow=TRUE)

rhs <- c(750, 900, 450, 13000, 12000, 5000, 900, 1200, 750)
direction <- rep("<=", 9)

# Solve LP
solution <- lp("max", objective, constraints, direction, rhs)
solution$objval 
solution$solution   
```

**3. Results & Interpretation**
The model produced the following results:

- Optimal Profit: $708,000 per day
- Production Plan:
  - Plant 1: 350 Large, 400 Medium, 0 Small
  - Plant 2: 0 Large, 400 Medium, 500 Small
  - Plant 3: 0 Large, 133.33 Medium, 250 Small

Interpretation:
- Plant 1 focuses entirely on Large and Medium products.
- Plant 2 balances Medium and Small production, but no Large units.
- Plant 3 allocates remaining demand primarily to Medium and Small sizes.
- The solution respects all constraints (capacity, storage, demand) and ensures optimal profit.
